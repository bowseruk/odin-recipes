                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Blitz 1 quartered onion, 2 garlic cloves, a thumb-sized chunk of ginger and ½ red chilli together in a food processor until it becomes a coarse paste.</li>
                    <li>Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a large saucepan and add the paste, fry for 5 mins, until softened. If it starts to stick to the pan at all, add a splash of water.</li>
                    <li>Tip in ½ tsp turmeric, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp ground coriander and 1-2 tsp hot chilli powder and stir well, cook for a couple of mins to toast them a bit, then add 4 chicken breasts, cut into chunks. Stir and make sure everything is covered in the spice mix.</li>
                    <li>Cook until the chicken begins to turn pale, adding a small splash of water if it sticks to the base of the pan at all.</li>
                    <li>Pour in 400g can chopped tomatoes, along with a big pinch of salt, cover and cook on a low heat for 30 mins, until the chicken is tender.</li>
                    <li>Stir through small pack of coriander and serve with rice, naan and a big dollop of mango chutney.</li>
